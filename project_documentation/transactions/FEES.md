- Real-time calculation updates as user inputs change
- Consistent currency formatting across all displays

## Real-time Fee Calculation

### Calculation Logic
- **Total**: Always Transaction Amount - All Fees (consistent across all transactions)
- **Real-time**: Fees calculate when transaction amount + required fields are filled or changed
- **Breakdown**: Expandable details showing each fee component
- **Cache**: Fees cached by transaction parameters including recipient address

### Fee Calculation Engine
- **Real-time**: Calculates fees as user inputs data
- **Caching**: Prevents duplicate calculations for same parameters
- **Network Detection**: Dynamic fee calculation based on detected networks
- **No Minimums**: Exact percentage calculations without artificial floors
- **Separate Fee Types**: Payment fees and DEX fees calculated separately
- **UI Treatment**: show fees with 2 decimals rounding the last number

## On-Chain Status and Fee Collection

### Funds and On-Chain Transaction Status
**Scope**: On-Chain Transaction Status validation before transferring funds

- **diBoaS fees**: Only deposit diBoaS fees when the transaction returns Success from On-Chain Transaction status
  - **diBoaS deposit account**: wallet address on Solana network to receive the fees
- **user's funds**: Only update the Available Balance or Invested Balance as well as the asset list or Goal Strategies after the On-Chain success message
- **On-Chain transaction link**: add the transaction link into the transaction history together with the transaction data, not only for successful transactions, but also for failed transactions
  - For failed transaction do NOT change the funds on the Available Balance or Invested Balance and add an information that the funds were not changed in the transaction history with the data of the failed transaction
- **P.S.**: For now there should be a mockup service simulating this On-Chain answer
  - taking 2 seconds for all transactions and assets to send the successful message
