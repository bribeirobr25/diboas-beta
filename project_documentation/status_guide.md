## Part III: Transaction State Management

### Universal State Machine

#### Primary States
- `INITIATED` - Transaction command received and validated
- `BALANCE_RESERVED` - Funds locked for transaction processing
- `PROVIDER_SELECTED` - Optimal provider chosen for transaction
- `PROVIDER_PROCESSING` - External provider handling transaction
- `BLOCKCHAIN_PENDING` - On-chain transaction submitted and pending
- `BLOCKCHAIN_CONFIRMED` - On-chain transaction confirmed
- `BALANCE_UPDATED` - Wallet balances updated
- `COMPLETED` - Transaction fully processed
- `FAILED` - Transaction failed permanently
- `COMPENSATING` - Running compensation for failed transaction

#### Sub-States (Context Dependent)

**Payment Processing Sub-States**:
- `PAYMENT_METHOD_AUTHORIZING`
- `FIAT_PAYMENT_PENDING`
- `FIAT_PAYMENT_CONFIRMED`
- `CONVERSION_PENDING`
- `CONVERSION_COMPLETED`

**Blockchain Transaction Sub-States**:
- `TRANSACTION_BUILDING`
- `TRANSACTION_SIGNING`
- `TRANSACTION_BROADCASTING`
- `MEMPOOL_PENDING`
- `BLOCK_CONFIRMATION_PENDING`
- `CONFIRMATION_COMPLETED`

### State Transition Rules

#### Valid State Transitions
```
INITIATED → [BALANCE_RESERVED, FAILED]
BALANCE_RESERVED → [PROVIDER_SELECTED, COMPENSATING]
PROVIDER_SELECTED → [PROVIDER_PROCESSING, PROVIDER_FAILOVER, COMPENSATING]
PROVIDER_PROCESSING → [BLOCKCHAIN_PENDING, BALANCE_UPDATED, PROVIDER_FAILOVER, COMPENSATING]
BLOCKCHAIN_PENDING → [BLOCKCHAIN_CONFIRMED, FAILED, COMPENSATING]
BLOCKCHAIN_CONFIRMED → [BALANCE_UPDATED, COMPENSATING]
BALANCE_UPDATED → [COMPLETED]
COMPENSATING → [FAILED, COMPLETED]
```

#### Forbidden Transitions
- Direct jumps to `COMPLETED` without balance updates
- `FAILED` to any state except through manual intervention
- `COMPLETED` to any other state (terminal)

### Transaction Step Orchestration

#### Step Types
- **Validation Step**: Input validation, compliance checks
- **Reservation Step**: Balance locking, resource allocation
- **Provider Step**: External system interaction
- **Blockchain Step**: On-chain transaction execution
- **Update Step**: Balance and state updates
- **Notification Step**: User and system notifications

#### Step Dependencies
- Each step defines prerequisites and success criteria
- Failed steps trigger specific compensation strategies
- Parallel steps where possible (e.g., validation + provider selection)
- Sequential steps where order matters (e.g., reserve → process → update)

## Part IV: Error Handling & Compensation Patterns

### Error Classification

#### Temporary Errors (Retry Eligible)
- Network timeouts
- Provider rate limiting
- Blockchain congestion
- Insufficient gas fees
- Mempool rejection

#### Permanent Errors (Immediate Failure)
- Insufficient balance
- Invalid recipient address
- Compliance violation
- Unsupported asset/chain
- Provider rejection

#### User Action Required
- Additional KYC verification
- High slippage confirmation
- Transaction timeout extension
- Payment method update
- Strategy parameter adjustment

### Compensation Strategies

#### Balance Compensation
- **Reservation Release**: Unlock reserved funds on failure
- **Partial Completion**: Handle cases where some steps succeeded
- **Double-Spend Prevention**: Ensure funds not counted twice
- **Audit Trail**: Track all balance changes for reconciliation

#### Provider Compensation
- **Refund Processing**: Handle fiat payment reversals
- **Failed Swap Recovery**: Retrieve assets from failed DEX operations
- **Strategy Exit**: Emergency exit from DeFi positions
- **Cross-Chain Recovery**: Handle bridge failures

#### Notification Compensation
- **Failure Notifications**: Clear error messages to users
- **Status Corrections**: Update incorrect transaction states
- **Recovery Instructions**: Guide users through resolution steps

### Saga Pattern Implementation

#### Choreography-Based Sagas (Preferred for Simple Flows)
- Each service publishes events and listens for responses
- Self-contained compensation logic in each service
- Suitable for linear transaction flows

#### Orchestration-Based Sagas (Complex Flows)
- Central saga orchestrator manages transaction flow
- Handles complex compensation scenarios
- Better for multi-provider, multi-step transactions

## Part V: Provider Integration Architecture

### Provider Abstraction Layer

#### Interface Definitions
- **OnRampProvider**: `initiateFiatToCrypto()`, `checkPaymentStatus()`, `cancelPayment()`
- **OffRampProvider**: `initiateCryptoToFiat()`, `checkWithdrawalStatus()`, `cancelWithdrawal()`
- **DEXProvider**: `getQuote()`, `executeSwap()`, `checkSwapStatus()`, `executeBridge()`
- **DeFiProvider**: `deployStrategy()`, `getStrategyStatus()`, `withdrawFromStrategy()`

#### Provider Selection Strategy
- **Cost Optimization**: Choose providers with lowest fees
- **Speed Optimization**: Prioritize fastest execution times
- **Reliability Scoring**: Based on historical success rates
- **Geographic Preference**: Local providers for compliance
- **User Preference**: Allow user to select preferred providers

#### Failover Mechanisms
- **Automatic Failover**: Switch to backup provider on failure
- **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable failing providers
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous provider performance tracking
- **Manual Override**: Admin ability to disable/enable providers

### Provider Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Patterns (Real-time)
- Initial request/response for quotes and validations
- Immediate error responses for invalid requests
- Status checks for quick operations

#### Asynchronous Patterns (Long-running)
- Webhook notifications for transaction updates
- Polling mechanisms for status checks
- Event-driven updates for blockchain confirmations

#### Idempotency Handling
- Unique request IDs for all provider calls
- Duplicate request detection and handling
- Safe retry mechanisms without double processing

## Part VI: Balance Management Architecture

### Balance Types & Transitions

#### Available Balance (USDC on SOL)
- **Asset Type**: USDC on Solana chain only
- **Storage**: Physical asset in user's non-custodial Solana wallet
- **Sources**: Deposits, sell transactions, strategy withdrawals
- **Uses**: Sends, withdrawals, buy transactions, strategy launches
- **Constraints**: Must maintain minimum balance for transaction fees
- **Reconciliation**: Real-time with Solana network

#### Invested Balance (BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI)
- **Asset Types**: BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and tokenized assets (excludes USDC)
- **Storage**: Physical assets in user's non-custodial wallets across 4 supported chains
- **Sources**: Buy transactions (on-chain and on-ramp)
- **Uses**: Sell transactions, external withdrawals
- **Constraints**: Asset-specific minimum amounts
- **Reconciliation**: Multi-chain balance verification with actual wallet holdings

#### Strategy Balance (Virtual DeFi Tracking)
- **Asset Type**: Virtual balance tracking, not physical storage
- **Storage**: Tracking data only - funds deployed in 3rd party DeFi protocols
- **Sources**: Strategy launches from available balance (initial amount)
- **Uses**: Strategy stops to available balance (final amount including P&L)
- **Constraints**: Provider-specific lock periods and minimum amounts
- **Reconciliation**: Live P&L updates from DeFi protocol providers

### Balance Reservation System

#### Reservation Lifecycle
1. **Pre-Transaction**: Lock funds before processing
2. **During Processing**: Maintain lock during provider interactions
3. **Completion**: Release lock and update actual balances
4. **Failure**: Release lock without balance changes

#### Reservation Types
- **Hard Reservation**: Funds completely unavailable
- **Soft Reservation**: Funds marked but still visible
- **Partial Reservation**: Reserve portion for fees, keep rest available

### Balance Reconciliation

#### Real-time Reconciliation
- Compare platform balances with on-chain data
- Alert on discrepancies above threshold
- Automatic correction for minor differences

#### Batch Reconciliation
- Daily full balance verification
- Historical transaction replay for audit
- Provider balance confirmation

## Part VII: User Experience & Communication

### Status Communication Strategy

#### User-Facing Status Messages
- **Simple Language**: Avoid technical jargon
- **Progress Indicators**: Show completion percentage where possible
- **Time Estimates**: Provide realistic completion timeframes
- **Next Steps**: Clear instructions for user actions

#### Status Message Categories
- **Informational**: "Your transaction is being processed"
- **Warning**: "High network fees detected, continue?"
- **Error**: "Transaction failed - insufficient balance"
- **Success**: "$100 successfully added to your wallet"

#### Real-time Updates
- **WebSocket Connections**: Live status updates
- **Push Notifications**: Important status changes
- **Email Notifications**: Transaction confirmations and failures
- **In-app Notifications**: Timeline of transaction progress

### Error Message Framework

#### Error Message Structure
- **What Happened**: Clear description of the issue
- **Why It Happened**: Context about the cause
- **What To Do**: Actionable next steps
- **Alternative Options**: Other ways to achieve the goal

#### Error Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required, funds at risk
- **High**: Transaction failed, user action needed
- **Medium**: Warning about potential issues
- **Low**: Information about minor delays or issues

## Part VIII: Transaction History & Activity Tracking

### Historical Data Requirements

#### Transaction Records
- **Immutable Log**: All transaction attempts and outcomes
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every state change and provider interaction
